## Description

```

## Working of the Application

```
The quiz Master offers different types of quiz games for the user.
Currently only one quiz type (Bird Quiz) is coded to work.

When 'Bird Quiz" is chosen, "Start Quiz" button will appear for the user to click and be ready to take the actual quiz, the timer also will start at that time. The questions are images, with some set of question choices.
Every time the user chooses an answer, they will be taken to the next question. If the answer is incorrect, 10sec will be subtracted from the timer.

When the end of the question is reached, the timer will stop and that will be the score of the user. The score will be shown to the user. It also will be stored to the localstorage as highest score, if the score saved already is not higher than the current score.

There is also Option to clear the score and start over.

```

## Future Developments

```
Eventually want to code more quiz types like 'Color Quiz", "animal Quiz", "Number Quiz", reusing 90% of the same code, without having to have code redundancy.
This will be a good learning app for young kids.
